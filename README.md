# EvolutionGenerator

Evolution Generator is implemented in Java, using Swing to create a graphical interface.
Program runs a simulation of the animal world and enables user to follow
their evolution. Each animal has its energy and genome. Every day they can eat grass (gain energy), move in one of eight directions (depending on their genome - the higher number on each position the more probable that animal will choose this direction) and reproduce with the others. User can follow the most interesting organisms and display their genomes.
